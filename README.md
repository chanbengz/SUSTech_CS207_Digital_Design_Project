# SUSTech CS207 Digital Design Project<br> Piano
A Mini Piano Toy ~~not playable~~
</div>

## Introduction
In this semester project, we implement a piano toy with learn mode
and music player on the Xilinx(TM) FPGA EGO1 board, and the code
is written in `Verilog`. Inside the piano, we put three songs,
`Twinkle Twinkle Little Star`, `Haruhigake` and `Ode to Joy`.
The implementation seems quite simple and straight forward, but it works pretty well.
That's exactly what we need. Anyway, enjoy your time with the toy!
